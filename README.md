Tic tac toe code challenge
--------------------------

This basic Django app implements an AI tic-tac-toe player who will not lose.

To play, to go /tictactoe. The rest is self explanatory.

Bonus: The game is more or less playable in w3m from the commandline.

Instructions:
1. Fork this repo on github.
2. Create an app that can interactively play the game of Tic Tac Toe against another player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages.
4. Push your code back to github and send me a pull request.
